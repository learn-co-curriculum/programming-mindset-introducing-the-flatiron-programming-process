# Introducing the Flatiron Programming Process

## Learning Goals

- Identify the steps of the Flatiron Programming Process

## Introduction

Now that we've started thinking a like a programmer, let's go deeper with some
specific, tried-and-true Flatiron strategies for solving a code problem.

## Identify the Steps of the Flatiron Programming Process

We can break the Flatiron Process down into seven steps:

1) Identify the problem
2) Identify the output that would solve the problem
3) Name the procedure that fixes the problem
4) Identify what inputs are needed to create the output
5) Define the procedure’s implementation
6) Translate the procedure description into code
7) Verify the procedure's output

### Identify the Problem

When you run into a programming problem, it's easy to get lost in the code. Take
a step back and think about what you're trying to accomplish beyond the output.
What is the essential goal you're trying to reach? For example, what are the
needs of the customer you're coding for? Determining the answer to this
establishes your context and makes sure you keep the appropriate perspective on
the reality of the problem.

### Identify the Output That Would Solve the Problem

After you've figured out what general solution you want, it's time to get a
little more specific. What output is going to fit that solution? For example,
maybe you can pinpoint that your result should be an average of numbers, or a
whole number with two-places of numbers after the decimal. Or a
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, divided diagonally into two triangles. Or a
beautiful Persian rug that really ties the room together. It all depends on what
the problem is. But once you've determined the precise output, you can start
building a plan towards it.

### Name the Procedure That Fixes the Problem

What will produce the desired output? If we need that average, we add together
all of the values in our set and divide by the number of the values, to get a
whole number with two-places of numbers after the decimal. If we need a
sandwich, we assemble the peanut butter, jelly and bread, and make a diagonal
cut. If we need the perfect Persian rug ... well, that might get complicated.
But there are steps to take to get it. Identify the steps and find a place to
start.

### Identify What Inputs Are Needed to Create the Output

In order to start the steps of getting the output, we have to know what items
we're going to need during the process. To continue our examples:

- If we want an average of numbers, we need all of those values and the total number of values;
- If we want a sandwich, we'll need the ingredients (peanut butter, jelly and bread) and tools (a knife, cutting board, plate);
- If we want a rug, we'll need thread, a loom and a pattern (or maybe the address of a rug dealership and directions to get there plus a truck, if we want to skip a few steps).

No input, no output. You now know what your output should be, so figure out what
input will get it.

### Define the Procedure’s Implementation

Because earlier we named the procedure we'll need to use, we have an idea of
what implementation will be like. But, just like how we needed to get detailed
about the input, we need to dig into implementation and build out our
understanding of its process.

Implementation, simply stated, is the set of steps that combine inputs to
produce outputs. If we've clearly identified inputs, desired ouputs and
neccessary procedures, the steps we need to take should fall into place. Let's
take the above example of averaging numbers:

1. Input values
2. Add values
3. Output total value
4. Output number of values
5. Divide total value by number of values
6. Output average value

When it comes to code, it's important to remember that you don't only want to
implement your solution, you want to optimize your implementation. To find ways
to keep your implementation simple and readable, you can use documentation to
see if heavy lifting work has already been done for you. If you see that it has,
but you don’t understand how to use it, experiment in IRB and bring your new
understanding to your implementation’s design.

### Translate the Procedure Description into Code

Okay. Got all that? Now ... let's code it. Take the description of the procedure
you came up with and, guided by the syntax of the particular language you're
working with, translate it into code. We've done so much work before this point
that while the coding part might not necessarily be easy, you will at least have
every advantage you could have to make it flow better for you.

### Verify the Procedure’s Output

You've got your code. It's go time. Test it out! What output did you get? If it
wasn't your desired output, don't worry too much about it. Testing and revision
is a natural part of the programming process. Now we have a sub-process to loop
through:

1. Adjust input
2. Adjust implementation
3. Spin-off sub-procedures
4. Verify output (if necessary)
5. Move from success to success, accumulating success

There's no limit on how many times you'll need to go through this verification
process. Sometimes problems are complicated and you'll need to make many
revisions to get the right solution. But by relying on this methodology, you'll
be able to know you're still on the right track until you get there.

## Conclusion

Remember—coding is your last step before verifying your output! The more we can
break down and think through a problem, using this Flatiron process, the easier
and better our code will be, which is exactly why we use it.
